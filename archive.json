The P-CS-computed CATS routes will be distributed among the overlay CATS-Routers, and will not affect the underlay nodes.\r\n\r\nThis reads like a pretty strong statement. It not only assumes that CATS routers are distinct from IP/MPLS routers of the underlay (which is highly debatable). It also asssumes that CATS routers will not affect (whatever that means) undermlay nodes: it seems to me that LIBs and FIBs maintaintes by PE routers (for example) may very well be populated by P-CS-computed routes (at least I fail to understand why not). So, I thi\u00e7nk this should deserve some elaboration. In addition, the IP/MPLSunderlay could contribute to the improvement of C-PS-computed routes (e.g., by means of Segment Routing). So, I don't think the underlay/overlay is that black and white.",
